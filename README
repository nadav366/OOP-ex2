SpaceShipRunner.java - A class that is an runner space ship.
SpaceShipBasher.java - A class that is an Basher space ship.
SpaceShipHuman.java - A class that is an Human space ship, Which the user controls with the graphical interface.
SpaceShipDrunkard.java - A class that is an Drunkard space ship.
SpaceShipSpecial.java - A class that is an Special space ship.

SpaceShipFactory.java - A class that initializes all space ships, depending on the user's choice.

=============================
A file that is a Space Ships game.
I got the graphical interface and the game engine, and  wrote
the various ship classes and class that initializes all space ships.

Since each ship has a certain type, I chose to implement an abstract class - SpaceShip that gives the
ship the general features and operations of all ships -
Health, maximum and current energy, shield status, and physics object.
In addition, the class gives the ships the basic operations of shooting, collision, hit, death,
image handling, transcription, and part of the line that is common to all ships.

Each class of a special ship extends from the general ship class all the attributes and implements the special
 doAction for each ship.
Some ships need to override additional functions to accommodate the ship's special features.

In this way, in my opinion, modular program that can be easily add and remove types of ships.
Even within each ship you can easily control its functions and behavior.

=============================
=       Special ships       =
=============================
Drunkard - The drunken movement is divided into 70 revolutions in mode, and then 50 accelerates straight.
           In each mode, he randomly encounters a guy (left or right) and moves toward him without speeding.
           When he is out of mod he can randomly teleport and shoot.

Special - The special ship has two modes -
          Attack mode, When it has enough energy, it tries to approach the ships and then attack them
           aggressively, at a very rapid shooting rate, wearing a shield before a collision.
          When the ship does not have enough energy, it moves away from all ships to charge and gain energy
           for another aggressive round.


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
Some of the SpaceShip features are protected, allowing the Bat ships to have their own special fiche.

Since all the ships have the same image, except for the human, I chose to use the general ship in the normal
picture, and in the human ship department to override the function and put the correct image.
